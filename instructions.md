The tasks are designed to mirror realistic work tasks without taking too much of your time,
so feel free to make reasonable assumptions to simplify your work. The entire project
shouldn’t take more than 4 hours. The objective is to test your familiarity with the
technologies we use at Murray Irrigation and your communication skills. You may use AI for
assistance, but you should understand and be able to explain the code during follow-up
interviews, where we will ask follow-up questions.
In Murray Irrigation, technicians need to monitor any abnormal signals. Good news is that
our control systems return a list of data tags with "good", "uncertain", and "bad" labels.
Technicians need to see trends of data over weeks, but also zoom in over minutes. One
device can have multiple sensors. Technicians need to be able to compare readings
between sensors and devices. This is because data might be auto tagged bad even though
it is within a subjective reasonable range, and vice versa. Sample data is stored in the
attached data.json file.
Task 1: Create a low fidelity design and short explanations on your design choices. It
should fit on a single page. You should demonstrate your ability to create good UX and
insight on how to create good data visualization that solves Technician's problems.
Task 2: Create a React website for the data visualization from task 1. You must use React,
Typescript, and Tailwind. You must also deploy the webpage for us to test.
You should demonstrate your ability to write clean code and your understanding of React
states and hooks. You can use external libraries and check out vercel if you don’t have a
favourite free webhosting service.
